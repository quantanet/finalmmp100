    <h1>SLEEP. DON'T WASTE IT.</h1>
    <h2>By Maruf A</h2>
    <p>I chose to tell the story of time and how it is taken for granted, as well as how time can be used to improve sleep. To represent interstellar space and to emphasize that time is a man-made construct, I chose to begin the project with someone opening their eye and then continuing through space. The video assets and sound are related to the time theme. The most difficult aspect of the project was locating video and sound assets that could be used because not all of the assets available in the public domain met my visual expectations for the project.</p>
